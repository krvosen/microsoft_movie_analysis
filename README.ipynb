The analysis of the movie industry allowed us to make an informed decision about what genre of movie Microsoft should produce and when to release it. What Microsofts worldwide gross should be compared to its budget. Lastly, what the runtime should be for each of Microsofts movies. Microsoft can use our informed decisions to create the best chance of making a succesful movie.  \n"
